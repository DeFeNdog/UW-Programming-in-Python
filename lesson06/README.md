# Lesson 06
### Unit Testing and Advanced Argument Passing

## Assignments & Exercises
* Mailroom, Part 4

## Learning Objectives
1. write automated unit tests to verify and validate the behavior of their programs
2. use a test driven approach to development, which encourages writing tests first, and using tests not only to validate program behavior, but also to measure development progress
3. use argument passing appropriately to protect data and reduce defects, by applying concepts like immutability of arguments
